== Available states

=== `syslog_ng`

Installs and configures the syslog_ng package.

=== `syslog_ng.package`

Installs the syslog_ng package and optional packages which may provide
additional functionalities.

=== `syslog_ng.config`

This state manages the file `syslog_ng.conf` under `/etc/syslog-ng`
(template found in "syslog_ng/files"). The configuration is populated by
values in "syslog_ng/map.jinja" based on the package's default values
(and RedHat, Debian, Suse and Arch family distribution specific values),
which can then be overridden by values of the same name in pillar.

=== `syslog_ng.service`

Manages the startup and running state of the syslog_ng service.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `syslog_ng` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
